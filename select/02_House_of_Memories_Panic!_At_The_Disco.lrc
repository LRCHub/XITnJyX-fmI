[00:07.00] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[00:11.23] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[00:21.23] 
[00:15.45] If you're a lover, you should know
[00:17.40] The lonely moments just get lonelier
[00:20.02] The longer you're in love
[00:22.12] Than if you were alone
[00:23.85] Memories turn into daydreams
[00:27.52] Become a taboo
[00:34.52] 
[00:32.67] I don't want to be afraid
[00:35.31] The deeper that I go
[00:37.70] It takes my breath away
[00:39.66] Soft hearts, electric souls
[00:41.68] Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
[00:45.29] Is this taboo?
[00:52.29] 
[00:49.55] Baby, we built this house
[00:52.44] On memories
[00:54.34] Take my picture now
[00:56.64] Shake it 'til you see it
[00:58.54] And when your fantasies
[01:00.88] Become your legacy
[01:02.74] Promise me a place
[01:05.71] In your house of memories
[01:18.21] 
[01:08.07] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[01:12.32] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[01:22.32] 
[01:16.23] I think of you from time to time
[01:18.84] More than I thought I would
[01:21.06] You were just too kind
[01:23.37] And I was too young to know
[01:24.89] That's all that really matters
[01:28.88] I was a fool
[01:34.88] 
[01:33.22] Baby, we built this house
[01:36.12] On memories
[01:38.08] Take my picture now
[01:40.28] Shake it 'til you see it
[01:42.20] And when your fantasies
[01:44.30] Become your legacy
[01:46.26] Promise me a place
[01:49.33] In your house of memories
[02:01.83] 
[01:51.46] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[01:55.92] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[02:05.92] 
[02:10.05] Those thoughts of past lovers
[02:12.85] They'll always haunt me
[02:15.28] I wish I could believe
[02:17.98] You'd never ruined me
[02:20.46] Then will you remember
[02:22.97] Me in the same way
[02:26.36] As I remember you?
[02:35.36] 
[02:30.32] Baby, we built this house
[02:33.81] On memories
[02:36.05] Take my picture now
[02:38.44] Shake it 'til you see it
[02:40.48] And when your fantasies
[02:42.65] Become your legacy
[02:44.69] Promise me a place
[02:53.69] 
[02:48.92] Baby, we built this house
[02:52.28] On memories
[02:53.73] Take my picture now
[02:56.18] Shake it 'til you see it
[02:58.05] And when your fantasies
[03:00.03] Become your legacy
[03:02.27] Promise me a place
[03:05.27] In your house of memories
[03:17.77] 
[03:07.25] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[03:11.76] Whoa-oh-oh
[03:14.06] In your house of memories
[03:16.35] Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[03:19.76] Promise me a place
