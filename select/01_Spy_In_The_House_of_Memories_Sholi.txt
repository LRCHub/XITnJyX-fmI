Will you take? 'cause you're making us strong
Selfish love, 'cause there is no other
And we'll sweep, off the floors into arms
Bathwater of the last twenty years
With the Jewels floating up
Somewhere along the lines turned to dots
The children they came and redrew it all wrong
Face in the hand, man in the black
Staring at skin he'll never get back
And we'll row through the fields through the farms
Watching out for the fruits below us
Funny thing, to think we're looking out
For the ones that will only hurt us
...
Feel your way on out of here
Feel your way back in
Take your mind, it's not wanted here
We decide what we cherish and what we forget
We leave on the other end
